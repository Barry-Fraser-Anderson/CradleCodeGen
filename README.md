# CradleCodeGen
An HTML form to generate input for the Cradle security code generator. 
It was written a long time ago as an exercise.

The 'Licenses' section is reconfigured by the JavaScript, dependent on input selections.

A lot of input validation is performed by the JavaScript and an error message is displayed as appropriate when 'Apply' is pressed.

If successful, the output string displayed could be used as input to the Cradle codegen executable.
