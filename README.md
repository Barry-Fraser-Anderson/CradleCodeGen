# CradleCodeGen

# Synopsis
An HTML form to generate input for the Cradle security code generator. 
It was written a long time ago as an exercise, and for my personal use.

The available licenses in the 'Licenses' section are reconfigured by the JavaScript dependent on the Cradle version selected.

A lot of input validation is performed by the JavaScript and an error message is displayed as appropriate when 'Apply' is pressed.

If successful, the output string displayed is used as input to the Cradle codegen executable.
